Digging up a raspberry patch,
Running a bath for someone,
Cooking a paella,
Watching Taskmaster,
Been at the allotment,
Going out for a wander,
Taking pictures of a vegetable risotto,
Cooking a roast gammon,
Just going to B&Q,
Building a Billy bookcase,
Waiting for Steph to cook Fajitas,
At the Zoom pub,
I can smell dinner,
My Xbox has gone into a state of idle,
Convincing Steph to cook tacos,
